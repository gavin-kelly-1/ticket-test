You can use this issue template to create a data processing task. This type of task is designed to capture data processing steps that sit outside of any configured work package. For example when only data processing is required or an intermediate data processing step is required to process low-depth sequencing to generate QC. The latter here are generated by ASF to determine QC before committing to full-depth sequencing. This task can be activated outside of the closing of the Await Data issue by adding an Active label.

*Record a small description of the task here.*
